End-user
========

End-user documentation may not always be applicable. But if you have a user interface, here are the things that end-user documentation needs:

## Tutorials

A start to finish guide on how to use my product/service for the most common basic use-case

## How-To guides

Guides on how to do specific things, this should be added to as time goes on and new things come up
 * For things like libraries, think “How to create an API endpoint”
 * For things like tools think “How do i perform action x"

## Reference

Should contain 
 * reference on API and function calls and their parameters (if applicable)
 * How to use a specific feature
