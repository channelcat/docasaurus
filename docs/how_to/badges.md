Badges
======

Docasaurus badges can show the build status and coverage % of a git repo.  To add a badge to your repo, open Docasaurus
to the main page and enter your repo information.  Make sure add badge is checked.  The badge will be added to the main 
README.md file at the top, probably under the header.  Feel free to move it to the correct place after the initial 
commit.
